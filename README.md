# Liverpooldle
Welcome to Liverpooldle, a Liverpool-inspired Wordle site that is made by a Liverpool fan.

This is Version 1.0 of Liverpooldle.

## What is Wordle?
Wordle is a web-based word game. In the game, players have six attempts to guess a word, receiving feedback through colored tiles that indicate correct letters and their placement. In Liverpooldle's case, the word could be any Liverpool player. A single puzzle is released daily, with all players attempting to solve the same word.

## How is Liverpooldle different from the original Wordle?
Liverpooldle has a hint feature. With more than 200 players in the database, it can be difficult to guess some players. Hints can include the nationality, position, and first season. Also, you can guess words that don't have a meaning.

## If a player's last name has two words, for example Van Dijk, what will be the answer?
There will be no spacebar in Liverpooldle so if the word is Van Dijk, the answer will be VANDIJK. If the word is Mac Allister, the answer will be MACALLISTER.
